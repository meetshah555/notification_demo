## ⚙️ Setup Requirements

### Firebase Configuration

This project uses **FlutterFire CLI** for Firebase configuration. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project and generate the required configuration files.

### Missing Configuration Files

This repository **does not include** the following Firebase configuration files (you need to generate these for your own project):

- `firebase.json`
- `lib/firebase_options.dart`
- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `ios/Podfile.lock`

### Getting Started

1. **Install FlutterFire CLI:**
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase for your project:**
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   This will:
   - Create a new Firebase project (or select existing one)
   - Generate `firebase_options.dart`
   - Download platform-specific configuration files
   - Update your `pubspec.yaml` with required dependencies

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 📱 Android Configuration

The app includes proper Android configuration for:
- Java 11 compatibility with desugaring
- Notification permissions for Android 13+
- Firebase notification channel setup
- Custom notification icons
